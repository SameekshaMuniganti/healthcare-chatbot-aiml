# ðŸ©º Healthcare ChatBot (AI + ML Project)

This project is a simple yet powerful **AI-powered healthcare assistant**.  
It asks users about their symptoms, predicts possible diseases using **Machine Learning models**,  
and even suggests **precautions** to take.  

Itâ€™s not meant to replace doctors, but rather to show how **AI + ML can be applied in healthcare**.

## âœ¨ What it does
- Takes **symptoms** as input (like fever, cough, headache).  
- Predicts possible **diseases** using:
  - Decision Tree Classifier  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Checks **severity** of symptoms and advises if a doctor visit is needed.  
- Gives a short **description** of the predicted condition.  
- Suggests **precautions** to follow at home.  
- Speaks out the results with **text-to-speech** (pyttsx3).
